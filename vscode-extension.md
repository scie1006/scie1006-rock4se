To install the Python extension for Visual Studio Code in a way that makes it available to all users on a Linux system, particularly in the /usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions directory, follow these steps:  
Install the extension for a single user initially:  
- Install the Python extension from within VS Code as a regular user. This will place the extension files in the user's extensions directory (e.g., ~/.vscode/extensions). Locate the installed extension.
Navigate to the user's extensions directory and find the folder corresponding to the Python extension (e.g., ms-python.python-<version>).
- Copy the extension to the system-wide location:
- Copy the entire Python extension folder from the user's extensions directory to /usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions. This typically requires root privileges.

```
    sudo cp -r ~/.vscode/extensions/ms-python.python-<version> /usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/
```

```
    sudo cp -r ~/.vscode/extensions/ms-python.* /usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/
```
(Replace <version> with the actual version number of the installed extension.) Ensure correct permissions and executability.  
Verify that the copied extension files have appropriate permissions, especially ensuring that any helper executables within the extension are executable.


```
    sudo chmod +x $(find /usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/ms-python.python-<version> -type f -exec file {} \; | grep -E 'ELF[^,]+executable' | cut -d: -f1)
```


```
    sudo chmod +x $(find /usr/share/code/resources/app/extensions/ms-python.* -type f -exec file {} \; | grep -E 'ELF[^,]+executable' | cut -d: -f1)
```
- Restart VS Code.
  
After copying the extension and adjusting permissions, restart Visual Studio Code. The Python extension should now be recognized and available for all users on the system.
Note: This method ensures that the extension files are physically present in the system-wide location, allowing all users to access them without needing to install the extension individually. However, individual user settings and configurations related to the Python extension will still be stored in each user's respective settings files.
